# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that's often used as an introduction to learning game development and React programming. This project was created to showcase the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using the `useReducer` hook in React. It serves as a simple example of state management and user interactions in a React application.
